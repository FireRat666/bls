        =======================================================
        
        BANT-LIBS
        
        One stupid day in Banter, friends gathered for the Great Banter Bake-Off. Bigjon arrived with a smart tray of dead babies, announcing, “Get ready for wubuhadubdub!”
        
        Vanski, wielding a spatula shaped like a orgy, declared, “This bake-off will be high!” Meanwhile, DivineSlayer spun in with alicorn cats flying everywhere, shouting, “Who’s ready to party?”
        
        Ded Zed showed up dramatically, saying, “I’ve made 13 batches of ducks. Beat that!” Vanquisher entered last, carrying blenders that smelled like a mountain, claiming, “These will sleeping the competition!”
        
        Zephii floated in wearing a slippery apron, muttering, “I hope nobody notices I burned the wal-marts again.” Staticthreat brought a poor gadget that turned dragons into frosting, proudly saying, “This is how you thrust like a pro!”
        
        Kate, the enormous judge, announced, “Make a weird cake shaped like a CannaBanter!” Chaos erupted as Bigjon dropped naked grandma in the batter, Vanski’s PLURAL bisquits caught fire, and DivineSlayer ended up covered in squiggly frosting.
        
        In the end, RazorSmiles won with their stanky creation. Everyone laughed, angerly, and promised to return for another decrepid Banter adventure.

        TOP TEN VR GAMES OF 2024 - DEADPOOL
        
        The top 10 best VR games in 2024
        
        1. Cities VR
        If you love Cities: Skylines, but want to get in even closer to your metropolis, then Cities: VR was made for you. The same basic gameplay of designing and managing a city is the same as the original game, except the controls are reworked for more comfortable use in VR.
        
        It's worth taking a look at Cities: VR if you find the original too overwhelming also. The game's limited size means you're less likely to make an unmanageable sprawl. Plus, you can now explore your city at street level, allowing an even closer look at how your public services and neighborhoods are working.
        
        Get Cities: VR at the Meta Quest store for Meta Quest 3 now or for PSVR 2 at the PlayStation store.
        
        
        2. Hitman 3
        If you already bought the third installment of the World of Assassination Trilogy, you can get a free update that will enable VR for it. If you want to blend into Agent 47 just like he blends into a crowd, it's a fun way to try out your favorite missions again.
        
        Be warned though that the PC VR version is essentially the same as the old PSVR version of the game. That means no matter how much better your gaming PC's hardware is you won't notice much of a performance difference. Go into the game expecting some rather mediocre graphics and then you'll be able to enjoy sneaking and strangling fully.
        
        Get Hitman 3 VR access at the Steam store now.
        
        
        3. Jurassic World: Aftermath
        The recently updated Aftermath lets you explore the wreckage of the titular dinosaur theme park between the first and second films of the rebooted franchise. Stuck there while on a mission to find crucial research information from the labs, you've got to solve puzzles and hide from some familiar flesh-eating foes however you can.
        
        While being stalked by killer lizards from the past is scary, the game actually looks quite fun with its cell-shaded graphics. It'll be a novel experience for fans used to the more realistic look of the main series of movies, but sneaking through facilities and attractions to avoid scary dinosaurs is an exciting premise that'll inspire any VR gamer.
        
        Get Jurassic Park: Aftermath at the Meta Quest store or for PSVR 2 at the PlayStation store.
        
        
        4. Stride
        Freerunning is a great fit for VR (provided you have the stomach for it), and Stride has arrived to fill the niche. Leap, slide and wall-run across an unlimited city of rooftops in a challenge of how long you can keep going.
        
        It's a very physical game, requiring lots of arm movement to control your character. That only gets more difficult as the game introduces gunmen who try to take you out as you're running, but at least you've got a weapon of your own to attack back. With endless, timed and arena modes already in place, and a story mode on the way, this is a game with plenty of potential for virtual thrills.
        
        Get Stride at the Meta Quest store, Steam store or PlayStation store now. Note: PlayStation version is PSVR compatible only — it does not work with PSVR 2.
        
        
        5. Thumper
        You've never played a rhythm game like Thumper before. While it's still a matter of getting your inputs timed correctly to the music, the environment and tracks themselves are deliberately brutal, making each stage feel like a battle.
        
        Playing as a shiny "space beetle", you have to correctly hit the pads on the track while shifting lanes and avoiding dangerous spots or even enemy attacks. Once you've made it through, you can go on to the next level or try again for a high score. Or, considering the unrelenting tone of the game, perhaps you'll just need to take the headset off and take five.
        
        Get Thumper at the Meta Quest store, Steam store or PlayStation store now.
        
        
        6. Subnautica (PC)
        Immerse yourself in the unending ocean of planet 4546B with Subnautica's VR mode. The survival game's underwater-focussed gameplay works brilliantly, with your headset feeling like a diving helmet as you venture deeper into the water. Just remember to breathe.
        
        Your goal is the same as the usual game — collect resources to allow you to survive while you find a way off-planet. You'll build your bases and vehicles to make this easier, and to protect yourself from the more aggressive wildlife. Plus, while you're out scavenging, you may come across snippets of the game's narrative, explaining the history of the planet, and what became of your crewmates after your starship crashed under mysterious circumstances.
        
        Get Subnautica at the Steam store now.
        
        
        
        7. Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition
        Even without a VR headset, the stunning views and meticulously detailed aircraft of this flight sim are simply delicious to experience. But adding a compatible headset into the mix makes Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition, without a doubt, one of the best VR games around.
        
        With the first-person viewpoint offered by your helmet, you can examine all the buttons and switches up close, and gain an extra level of immersion as you take off and land at airports around the world, fly through the clouds and admire the landscapes below.
        
        If that sounds a bit overwhelming to you, then you'll be glad that the game lets you tailor how much of your plane's controls are automatically or manually controlled. If you want something more relaxing, you can just let the game take care of the hard stuff for you and enjoy flying around. But if you want to feel like an actual pilot, then you can take off the training wheels and tinker to your heart's content.
        
        Get Microsoft Flight Simulator 40th Anniversary Edition at the Steam store now.
        
        
        8. Star Wars: Squadrons
        With a first-person view out of your X-Wing or TIE Fighter cockpit, Star Wars: Squadrons is the latest and greatest way to experience space combat set in the timeline of the saga's original trilogy.
        
        Your chosen fighter, out of a list of famous Star Wars spacecraft, can also be customized to make it look and perform more like you want and need, depending on the mission at hand.
        
        In classic Star Wars tradition, there's a single-player campaign to enjoy too, with the Rebels and the Empire both getting their own sides of the story. But if fighting CPU-controlled opponents isn't satisfying you, there's also online multiplayer where you can assert your position as a flying ace.
        
        Get Star Wars: Squadrons at the Steam store or PlayStation store now. Note: PlayStation version is PSVR compatible only — it does not work with PSVR 2.
        
        
        9. Falcon Age
        It's you and your pet bird of prey against the world in this adventure game. Your home planet has been taken over by a robot empire, and after breaking out of prison with your new falcon friend, the only logical thing to do is start fighting back.
        
        As your falcon grows from chick to adult, it learns new tricks and abilities to help you on your way. Plus you can dress it up in cute costumes.
        
        With the falcon on one arm and a stun baton in the other, you'll be tasked by the resistance to free up areas of the map from machine control, bringing hope back to a community that's not got a lot of it left. It's one of the best VR games for players trying to lose themselves in a virtual world, with its uplifting story set in a beautifully rendered world.
        
        Get Falcon Age at the Meta Quest store, Steam store or PlayStation store now. Note: PlayStation version is PSVR compatible only — it does not work with PSVR 2.
        
        
        10. Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series
        Within a fortress on the planet Mustafar, surrounded by lava and burning rock, dwells the most famous Sith Lord in all the galaxy. And though you play just a common smuggler, you've got to infiltrate the place and find out what Vader is looking for.
        
        The game takes place over three parts, with your involvement in the story slowly becoming clearer as you venture further. Your path forwards is blocked by enemies, that you can take down with your lightsaber, and puzzles, which you'll need to use your mind and physics objects to conquer instead.
        
        If you want a break from the story, you can open up the game's included Lightsaber Dojo, where you can train in the art of wielding your elegant weapon from a more civilized age.
        
        Get Vader Immortal: A Star Wars VR Series at the Meta Quest store or PlayStation store now. Note: PlayStation version is PSVR compatible only — it does not work with PSVR 2.
